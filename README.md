UM boot camp module 1 assignment
# Over view of Kickstarter project
 
The overview of this project was to help an up-and-coming play writer, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign or a (kick starter), to help fund her plays. We used Excel to start sorting, organizing and analyzing a ton of crowdfunding date given to us. With this date we tired to give our customer the best odds at making a successful campaign and determine whether there a any specific factors that make a project successful.

### Analyzing the Information
I preformed my analysis by setting up a pivot table to help me understand at what time of the year the United States of America had the most successful campaign using that information I filtered for plays and figured out what plays had failed, been canceled, or were still live. I needed a better understanding of what the information in front of me was trying to tell me, so I created a line graph.

At this point in the analysis the line graph helped me see the outcomes based on lunch dates with that information I figured out that June had the highest success rate out all the other months.
