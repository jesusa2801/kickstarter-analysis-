UM boot camp module 1 assignment
# Over view of Kickstarter project
 
The overview of this project was to help an up-and-coming play writer, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign or a (kick starter), to help fund her plays. We used Excel to start sorting, organizing and analyzing a ton of crowdfunding data given to us. With this date we tired to give our customer the best odds at making a successful campaign and determine whether there a any specific factors that make a project successful.

### Analyzing the Information
I preformed my analysis by setting up a pivot table to help me understand at what time of the year the United States of America had the most successful campaign using that information I filtered for plays and figured out what plays had failed, been canceled, or were still live. I needed a better understanding of what the information in front of me was trying to tell me, so I created a line graph.

At this point in the analysis the line graph helped me see the outcomes based on lunch dates with that information I figured out that June had the highest success rate out all the other months, and Plays in general had a higher success rate than failure rate.
### Outcomes Based On Goals
After finishing with that data we could still filter out more useful information on how to set up a successful campaign using our Excel skills we managed to create filtered  data that visualized the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. We than went ahead and started a new sheet named outcome based on goals within that sheet we had a goals column that look something like this.
#### Goals Column

with that goals column I intended to populate the rows with the number of successful, number of failed, and number of canceled campaigns. I than summed up all the projects and add the values to the total project’s column.

when all that was done I calculated the percentages of the failed and successful projects and made a graph.

# Trouble Shooting And Mistakes

Now here’s where I had a bit of trouble, I couldn’t figure out how to apply the Countifs function and it wasn’t working, I spent hours looking for my mistake countless of YouTube video and I couldn’t figure out where I had gone wrong, I left it siting for a while and came back to it, it turns out that I had a couple of miss spelling on words like” successful” and “plays”, once I got that done the rest of the analysis was pretty much straight forward.

# Conclusion

With the outcomes based on goals information it tells us that the higher the goal the lower the chance of it being successful it becomes, and with the information we got from the theater chart, we can infer that June has the highest probability of it becoming successful. So if we were to gather all the info and broadcast it to the customer I would tell her to  start her kick starter with a low goal ratio and have it start in the beginnings of June.
